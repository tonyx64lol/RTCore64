# RTCore64_Vulnerability
RtCore64 Vulnerable driver mapper that works on Windows 10 & 11

Modified the source, its an undetected driver mapper (tested) which should make your P2C more undetected ‚ù§Ô∏è

## üíª Information
This mapper allows your to load any unsigned driver by abusing the RtCore64 Vulnerable driver, while also cleaning the following to prevent detection by anti-cheats.

## ‚ö† PLEASE NOTE ‚ö†
This project was just made for fun and to educate others. I do not condone Cheating in any way and i don't recommend using this to bypass any security measures.
